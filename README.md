## Introduction
The emergence of AI agents in biomedical research marks a significant paradigm shift in how we approach complex healthcare and biological challenges. While foundation models (language, vision, and multimodal) have shown remarkable capabilities in medical imaging, text analysis, and genomics, they face three major limitations: insufficient biomedical training data compared to general domains; the inherently open-ended nature of biomedical research questions where hallucination risks pose serious concerns; and their inability to support dynamic, iterative research workflows that require continuous feedback and adaptation. To address these challenges, LLM-powered AI agents have emerged as a promising solution, decomposing complex biomedical tasks into modular components handled by specialized foundation models, while using a master model to orchestrate the entire workflow and maintain dynamic reasoning chains. This approach has demonstrated success in various applications including chemical research automation, medical decision support, and scientific literature analysis. This repository collects and organizes key research papers and developments (up to November 2024) in biomedical AI agents, aiming to facilitate research and development in this rapidly evolving field.
